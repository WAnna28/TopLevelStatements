# TopLevelStatements
Example for Using Top-Level Statements (New 9.0)

While it is true that prior to C# 9.0, all C# .NET Core applications must have a Main() method, C# 9.0
introduces top-level statements, which eliminate the need for much of the ceremony around the C#
applicationâ€™s entry point. Both the class (Program) and Main() methods can be removed.
